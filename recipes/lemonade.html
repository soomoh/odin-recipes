    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>There is nothing like fresh Strawberry Lemonade. If you are craving something cold and refreshing, this is it! Adding fresh strawberries to Classic Lemonade makes it sweet and tangy.</p>

    <p>This is my favorite restaurant drink and I especially love getting those bits of fresh strawberry in the straw. It’s actually very easy to make it at home for a fraction of the price. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Homemade lemonade</strong> (1 recipe makes 10 cups), or Frozen Concentrate*</li>
        <li><strong>Strawberries</strong> – blend until smooth to add fresh strawberry taste and rosy color.</li>
        <li><strong>Basil</strong> – this is optional, but a small handful of basil adds exciting flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon Slices</strong> – add 1 slice to each glass for garnish if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Ice</strong> – add the ice as needed and add just before serving so it doesn’t dilute the lemonade.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make lemonade</strong> – prepare homemade lemonade or from concentrate and pour lemonade into a pitcher.</li>
        <li><strong>Strawberries</strong> – combine 3/4 of your strawberries with a small handful of basil in a good blender or food processor and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine</strong> – stir strawberry basil mixture into lemonade.</li>
        <li><strong>To Serve</strong> – pour lemonade over glasses of ice and garnish with remaining strawberries and lemon slices.</li>
    </ol>
