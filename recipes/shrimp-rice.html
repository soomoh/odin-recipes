    <h2 class="subhead">Description</h2>
    <div><p>Even though fried rice is easy to make, there are some things to know before you start to avoid gummy and sticky rice. I learned how to make (non-sticky) fried rice years ago from one of my favorite bloggers, Jaden of <a href="https://steamykitchen.com/">steamykitchen.com</a>.</p>

    <p>Once you have a great basic recipe for fried rice, you can easily change up the protein depending on what you have in the refrigerator or what leftovers you have from dinner the night before. That’s how we came up with our popular Chicken Fried Rice Recipe.</p></div>

    <h3 class="subhead">Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="list"><ul>
        <li><strong>Rice:</strong>cooked and chilled rice works best (more on that below)</li>
        <li><strong>Shrimp:</strong> use 20-24 count or 26-30 count RAW peeled and deveined shrimp.</li>
        <li><strong>Cornstarch</strong> – makes the shrimp slightly crisp when stir-fried like in our Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables</strong>: we use a bag of frozen peas and carrots that we thaw according to package instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: large eggs add more protein and great texture and color to this dish</li>
        <li><strong>Green onion</strong> – light and dark green parts, plus more to garnish</li>
        <li><strong>Soy Sauce</strong> – use regular, low sodium or even coconut aminos then add them to taste since they will have varying amounts of salt in them.</li>
        <li><strong>Sesame oil</strong> – DO NOT SKIP the sesame oil which makes it taste like authentic Chinese fried rice. Use pure sesame oil, not toasted.</li>
    </ul></div>

    <h3 class="subhead">Steps</h3>

    <div class="list"><ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate shrimp</strong> – toss shrimp together with cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Rest for 10 minutes at room temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the skillet</strong> – preheat over medium/high heat then add cooking oil and shrimp. Cook 1 minute per side. Transfer shrimp to a plate and reduce heat to medium.</li>
        <li><strong>Add beaten eggs</strong> – pour eggs into the hot skillet and scramble with your spatula until no longer runny. Transfer to the same plate as the shrimp.</li>
        <li><strong>Wipe down the skillet</strong> with a paper towel then increase to medium/high heat, add oil and chives, and saute for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread rice</strong> into the skillet and sizzle for 1-2 minutes without stirring. Flip and sizzle another 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Sauces & Veggies</strong> – drizzle in Soy sauce and sesame oil to taste then stir in vegetables.</li>
        <li><strong>Add cooked shrimp and eggs</strong> back to the pan and stir to combine and add more soy sauce to taste.</li>
    </ol></div>
